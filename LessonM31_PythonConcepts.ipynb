    "| 4           | Repetition  \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform assignments in Python, you should learn all about the type of data containers that are available to hold information in Python and that can be assigned with data values. These data containers are called objects and play a central role in Python programming. They are most fundamental components in Python programming. **In Python we do things with stuff: we focus on objects and what we can do with them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, in Python objects are actually more than just variable types and they intersect with all four pillars of the algorithms. Python is an object-oriented programming language, after all. It will become more clear along the way, once you progressed further in this course, that also squences, selections and repetitions can be part of Python objects. In Python terms, a programs consist of four major components that built a hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Programs are composed of **modules** (top of the hierarchy)\n",
    "2. Modules contain **statements**\n",
    "3. Statements contain **expressions**\n",
    "4. Expressions create and process **objects**  (bottom of the hierarchy)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the hierarchy stand Python *objects*, which are data elements (e.g. variables, ...). An *expression* is a combination of one or more objects that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another object. They are embedded in statements. *Statements* code the larger logic of a program (e.g. iteration, assignment, selections, ...). And *modules* are organization units at the highest-level. They package code for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect this herarchy to the pillars of algorithms, one can simplify this to:\n",
    "* Objects are holding data (i.e. they are variables).\n",
    "* Expressions perform operations on and between objects\n",
    "* Statements realize pillars of algorithms: assignment, sequences, selections and repetitions\n",
    "* Modules package entire algorithms (hence, various combinations of the four pillars of algorithms). \n",
    "\n",
    "This course module 3 focusses on objects and espressions available in Python, which is a prerequeisite for coding any kind of algorithm elements. We won't get completely around the other algorithmic concepts in this module. As you can see in the list above, Python realizes the pillars of algorithms through statements and even an assignment is technically a statement. However, to define and operate on Python objects, we will perform plenty of assignments. In addition, several assignments and object operations combined build also a sequence. We will also discuss built-in functions that come with each Python object. However, in this course module 3, our focus will stay completely on the objects and the operations (expressions) that we can perform with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding modules, you have already used the *math* module, in the previous exercise. Such a module is an external package, which contains a vast amount of structured code defining objects, performing expressions and statements. A module basically provides pre-programmed algorithms that are available to be integrated into any program. We will discuss higher hierarchy elements and the other pillars of algorithms in Python in course module 4. \n",

However, it is part of the logic of the Python programming language. These abstract concepts are discussed to make it possible for you to understand in detail how Python works and to write a Python code that uniquely defines and executes the purpose of your program.\n",

Objectes are essentially just pieces of memory, with values and sets of associtated operations. Actually everything is an object in a Python script. Even simple numbers qualify, they have values (e.g, 12) and supported operations (addition, multiplication, ...) (Lutz, 2013).\n",

But remember Python is object-oriented and this apparent contradiction will resolve along the way. \n",

    "Python attributes each of these object types very specific characteristics, abilities, and in some cases, built-in functions. In the upcoming course module 3, we will cover the details of the first eight of these object types. The types in the last row (program unit types) will be discussed in course modules 4 and 5.\n",

    "While a statically-typed language like C or Java requires each variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically-typed language like Python skips this specification. For example, in C you might specify a particular operation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",

    "result = 0\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
