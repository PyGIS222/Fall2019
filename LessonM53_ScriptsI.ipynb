    "# Purpose of this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already created a simple Python script during course module 3, when working on the Jupyter Notebook `Lesson36_Files.ipynb`. However, that time we haven't provided any further explanation, what scripts are for and why it is useful to put code into scripts. We would like to add this now. We will discuss how to write complete Python **scripts**, which are nothing else than either **Python programs** and/or **module** files. Along the way, we will also discuss how write our own **module** files. \n",
    "\n",
    "The two parts A and B of this notebook will guide you step-by-step through the process of writing an entire script. At the end of part B, you will have written a file `temp_converter.py` and saved it in the folder `assignments_M5a`. And you will be able to import this script as module or execute it as program. To allow for the best learning effect, start working on this by yourself. But we are also providing our version of the script file, as it should be at the end of this lesson. You can find it in the file `./data/temp_converter_SOLUTION.py`. You may use this solution to get some context at the beginning or to peak, debug or get inspired during this lesson.\n",

    "# A. An Introduction to Script Files\n",
    "### (And how to use them as modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this point, we have been keeping all of our Python code and Markdown comments in a single Jupyter notebook document (except for that one brief example when working on files). This is great, but there are some cases, like when you have long Python code blocks or a set of functions used in many notebooks, in which you may want to have Python code in a separate document to make sure your Jupyter notebook is easy to read.\n",
    "An alternative to typing in all of the commands you would like to run is to list them in a Python *script file*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The general concept of a .py script file\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python script file is simply a file containing a list of the commands you would like to run, normally with one command per line, and formatted in the same way as if you were to type them in a Jupyter Notebook, or into an interpreter prompt (e.g. on the terminal of this JupyterHub or command line of your computer, after running the command `python`).\n",
    "Python script files traditionally use the `.py` file extension in their names. \n",
    "As such, we can quite easily create a basic script file and test things out.\n"

    "Note: If you do not want to declare a `main()` function in your program `temp_converter.py`, you could also directly add the content of the `main()` function into the `if __main__...` statement. In this case, the module would not contain a `main()` function, and it is after all, optional to include write it. However, you will very regularily find content inside the `if __main__...` statement in Python programs."

    "Writing a Python module is the same as writing any other Python .py script file or program file. This notebook covered how to write definitions within a module and how to use those definitions in the form a Python program file.

    "The term **script** is used to describe any file containing code. For Python, a script file can be any `.py` file containing Python code. With that, a Python **module** is a script file that packages a number of objects, which may be variables, functions and also **classes**. A **program** is a script that contains more or less complex algorithms and typcially reads user input (from file, keyboard or any other device) and it results in output. A module mostly does not. Both programs and modules may also import other modules, define global variables and contain a `main()` function. However, objects defined in a program can be imported as a module without modifictaions, if the program is structured correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these terms are not used the same way by everyone, and cannot be discriminated fully from each other, this definition may help to differentiate the purpose of different `.py` files. \n",
