    "# Selecting Points Inside a Boundary: Shapely\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lesson parts, we have been loading imagery like a shaded relief, plot them and sliced them. Later, we will be doing something like this with science data and in those cases also calculate some map statistics. However, so far we have always been using a certain bounding box for our maps. In a more realistic scenario, we would be interested to retrieve data content for a certain geographical or political area, like an ocean region (like the Atlatnic), a river basin, a country or a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such boundaries are not lat/lon blocks, but defined by more complex polygons and we cannot simply slice them out of the arrays. To be able to select unregularly shaped region from a data array, we will peak into a module, which provides us with tools to perform exactly that: selecting raster data within a region. As you will see later, this is a very typical GIS problem, which reduces to the problem of finding out whether a **point falls inside a polygon**. But while this is an easy gasp if we can visually look at the data in a map, here we would like to code this in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "Below a brief insight into the module shapely. This will also be an outlook for GIS322, where this module will be discussed in more detail, as it provides basic procedures for a lot of GIS applications.\n",

    "The most fundamental geometric objects are Points, Lines and Polygons which are the basic ingredients when working with spatial data in vector format. Python has a specific module called Shapely, which can be used to create and work with planar geometric objects. There are many useful functionalities that you can do with Shapely such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a Line or Polygon from a Collection of Point geometries\n",
    "* Calculate areas/length/bounds etc. of input geometries\n",
    "* Make geometric operations based on the input geometries such as Union, Difference, Distance etc.\n",
    "* Make spatial queries between geometries such Intersects, Touches, Crosses, Within etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometric Objects consist of coordinate tuples where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Point-objects represent a single point in space. Points can be either two-dimensional (x, y) or three dimensional (x, y, z).\n",
    "* LineString-objects (i.e. a line) represent a sequence of points joined together to form a line. Hence, a line consist of a list of at least two coordinate tuples\n",
    "* Polygon objects represents a filled area that consists of a list of at least three coordinate tuples that forms the outerior ring and a (possible) list of hole polygons.\n",
