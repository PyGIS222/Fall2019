    "2. Modules contain **statements**\n",
    "3. Statements contain **expressions**\n",
    "4. Expressions create and process **objects**  (bottom of the hierarchy)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of the hierarchy stand Python *objects*, which are data elements (e.g. variables, ...). An *expression* is a combination of one or more objects that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another object. They are embedded in statements. *Statements* code the larger logic of a program (e.g. iteration, assignment, selections, ...). And *modules* are organization units at the highest-level. They package code for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect this herarchy to the pillars of algorithms, one can simplify this to:\n",
    "* Objects are holding data (i.e. they are variables).\n",

    "In simple terms, *statements* are the things that you write to tell Python what your program should do. If programs \"*do things with stuff*\", then statements are the way you specify what sort of things a program does. In this sense, Python is a preocedural, statement-based language. By combining statements, you specify a precedure that Python performs to satisfy a program's goal. (Lutz, 2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the conceptual hierarchy of Python, we have defined that statements contain expressions. At their base, programs written in the Python language are composed of statements and expressions. Expressions process objects and are abedded in statements. Statements code the larger logic of a program's operation. They perform actions, repeat tasks, make choices, and so on. Statements use and direct expressions to process the objects we studied in the preious module. Moreover, statements are where objects spring into existence (e.g. in expressions within assignment statements), and some statements create enirely new kinds of objects (functions, classes, and so on). At the top hierarcy, statements always exist in modules (i.e. program packages), which themselves are managed with statements. (Lutz, 2013) \n",
    "\n",
    "Table 3 summarizes available statements in Python and gives examples and literal syntax for them. Each has its own purpose and syntax. As you will see, some have common sytax patterns and some statement roles overlap. As mentioned above, the first and major statement is an assignment. One reason for this distinction from expressions is that an assignment in Python realizes not just the creation of an object, but also of its reference to a variable name. In previous lessons, we have already used the statements in row two and three of the table: calling functions and methods as well as printing objects to the display. We have also deleted references before (last row of Table 3). In this notebook we will discuss selecting actions, iterations and loops together with related statements for controlling loops (rows four to nine in Table 3). Statements lower in the table have to do with larger program units: functions, modules, classes and exceptions. These will be discussed during later notebook lessons of this course module. \n",

In between code you can create lines, that are ignored by the interpreter, if preceded by a `#`. Multiple lines can be commented by leading and trailing triple `'` or `\"` of the text block. You have seen plenty of examples in previous lesson and assignment notebooks.
