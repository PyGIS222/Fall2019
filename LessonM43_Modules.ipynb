    "\n",
    "## What is a module?\n",
    "\n",
    "A *module* in Python is simply a Python `.py` file that contains a list of related functions that can be loaded and used. In Python's conceptual hierarchy **modules are the highest-level organization units that package code for reuse.**\n",
    "Modules are similar to what are more generally called libraries in programming languages, which again contain code related to a specific task such as mathematical operations. \n",
    "There are a *HUGE* number of Python modules, and many of them greatly extend what can be done in a normal Python program.\n",
    "In fact, the abundance of free Python modules is one of the best reasons to learn and start using Python.\n",

    "## How can modules be loaded?\n",

    "Python modules can be loaded in a number of different ways.\n",

    "Let's start simple with the math module. We have used it briefly before. Now we will discuss how this actually worked.\n",

    "# Writing and Importing Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can contain definitions of functions, classes, and variables that can then be utilized in other Python programs. Some modules are available through the Python Standard Library and are therefore installed with your Python installation. Others can be installed with Pythonâ€™s package manager pip. Additionally, you can create your own Python modules since modules are comprised of Python .py files. This means, creating a new *.py*-files that package our own library of functions. This will allow you to import and use them in any Python interpreter, e.g. that of the jupyter Notebook, as well as within other programming files. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's begin with a very simple example. We want to write a Python module `hello`, which contains one function of the name `world` that simply prints the string \"Hello, World!\" to the screen, like this:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def world():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will leave out any other fancy code elements, like parameter passing, user input, file reading etc and just focus on how to create our own module. Later you can use this recipy to package more complex code. Now, go to the file browser of the JupyterHub, create a new textfile of the name `hello.py` and copy the function above into that file. Save and close it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the program on the command line with python hello.py nothing will happen since we have not told the program to do anything. It just defines a function.
