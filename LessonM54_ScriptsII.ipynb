    "# How to Write Scripts the 'right' way\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is part of Module 5 of the course GIS222 (Fall2019). This notebook gives important tips for documenting and commenting the content of your scripts. One of the big advantages of using scripts is including features that make the code easier to read and understand. These include comments in the code, which explain what the code does, but are not executed when the code is run. As your scripts get longer and more complicated, features such as comments will become essential. Below are some suggestions to make sure your code is formatted nicely and easy to understand.\n",

    "\n",
    "Inline comments are comments within the code that explain what certain lines of the code do. To you, it may seem obvious how the code works, but if you share it with another person perhaps they will not feel the same way. This is particularly true when you start using scripts instead of Jupyter notebooks, where you might not feel you can include as much text describing your code. Because we want to teach you to code in an effective way, it is a very good idea to make your scripts as easy to read as possible for people. Consider the example below."

Adding comments to scripts is essential for scientists like ourselves to both help us remember how a script works and to make it easier to share with colleagues. It is best to get into the habit of adding comments as you write, especially if youâ€™re not using a Jupyter notebook."
