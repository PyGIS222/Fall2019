    "The fact that the tuple data type is a sequenced data type that cannot be modified, offers optimization to your programs. Tuples are a somewhat faster type than lists for Python to process. When others collaborate with you on your code, your use of tuples will convey to them that you don’t intend for those sequences of values to be modified. Besides that, tuples might have advantages for certain data types. Due to their immutability, they can take over the rolse of a *constant* declaration. Most commonly they are used as dictionary keys (in contrast to lists), as keys must be immutable, too. This is helpful, when generating larger dictionaries and to use entire datasets as keys. \n",

    "For example, the graphic above shows a collection of geometric objects, with each being distinctly different from the other. Such an collection of distinct objects is considered as an object in its own right. The purpose of sets is to construct and manipulate unsorted collections of unique elements, in order to support mathematical applications or to analyze complex data structures. For the set in Figure 1, we might be interested in finding geometrical objects that have four corners and are of color green. For such an analysis set theory concept *Intersection* would help us (Figure 2). Major concepts in set theory are explained in Table 3.\n",

If all the members of set A are also members of set B, then A is a subset of B, denoted A ⊆ B. For example, {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3} , and so is {2} but {1, 4} is not. B is also called superset of A.|\n",
