    "A function is a block of organized, reusable code that can make your scripts more effective, easier to read, and simple to manage.\n",
    "You can think functions as little self-contained programs that can perform a specific task which you can use repeatedly in your code. **Functions are housing smaller algorithms, which are used repeatedly in a program.** One of the basic principles in good programming is \"do not to repeat yourself\".\n",
    "In other words, you should avoid having duplicate lines of code in your scripts.\n",
    "Functions are a good way to avoid such situations and they can save you a lot of time and effort as you don't need to tell the computer repeatedly what to do every time it does a common task, such as converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",
    "During the course we have already used some functions such as the `print()` command which is actually a built-in function in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in the coding assignments, you have already complemented functions. We had these prepared, so you and we can repeatedly test your code for different input. Now, we will discuss how you can code and use any kind of functions all by yourself."
