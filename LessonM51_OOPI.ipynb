Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on creating reusable patterns of code, in contrast to *procedural and structureal programming*, which focuses on explicit sequenced instructions. When working on complex programs in particular, object-oriented programming lets you reuse code and write code that is more readable, which in turn makes it more maintainable.\n",
